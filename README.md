## 💻 Junior Developer | Full-Stack Enthusiast | Cloud Learner

Hi there! I'm a junior developer with a strong passion for building scalable and efficient applications—or as I like to call it, turning coffee into clean code ☕💻. I enjoy working across the entire stack, from crafting pixel-perfect front-end experiences to developing rock-solid back-end solutions (yes, I talk to databases like they're my teammates).

I'm always learning, debugging, and occasionally wondering why my code works when it shouldn’t 🤔. I love exploring cloud computing, optimizing performance, and making sure my apps run smoothly (even if my Wi-Fi doesn’t).

Excited to build, break, and fix things while collaborating on impactful projects! Let’s create something awesome. 🚀
